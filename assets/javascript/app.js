// Timed Trivia Questions (HW Week 5 UA Coding Bootcamp)

// create an array of questions that are objects with false and correct answers as properties of the object

// declare variables as needed to make this thing tick

// var correct answer counter

// var incorrect answer counter

// var unanswered questions

// var score (as a percentage?)


// create functions that can be called to run the things the game does

// put the game itself into an object? Is this a good idea? look at some examples first

// I want to set up the game itelf as simplified as possible this time so that it can by run by calling functions instead of a giant mess of code like the last game. I will need to use setTimeout and setInterval functions which are new to me so I need to keep everything as tidy as possible around that

// Lets go over the game structure itself. I imagine user will want to click a start game option first

// when start game is clicked let's have that run a function that is the game itself, perhaps inside of an object so it can refer to it's own stuff easier? or maybe as a function that calls the other functions of the game and draws information from the objects representing the game's content.
